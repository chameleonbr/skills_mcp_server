A centralized, sandboxed Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to manage, execute, and expose advanced **Agent Skills** to any MCP-capable framework or low-code platform (like n8n, custom agents, etc.).

## 💡 The Problem It Solves

Currently, many popular orchestration frameworks and low-code platforms only support basic **tools** or **MCP**. However, modern AI agents require fully encapsulated, complex **agent skills** (prompts, tool chains, and logic combined). **Agno framework** natively supports these advanced agent skills, but getting them into platforms like n8n or custom agentic systems has historically been a challenge.

**`skills_mcp_server` is the bridge.** By wrapping Agno skills in an isolated FastAPI server and exposing them via the universal Model Context Protocol (MCP), **any** system that supports MCP can now instantly leverage complex agent skills.

## ✨ Key Advantages

* **🎯 Selective Skill Exposure (Context Optimization):** Install a massive library of skills on the server, but expose only the exact ones a specific agent needs. By tailoring the skill list per agent, you prevent LLM context bloat, save tokens, and drastically improve agent accuracy.
* **🗄️ Centralized Skill Hub:** Stop scattering custom scripts and functions across different repositories or n8n nodes. Manage your entire organization's AI capabilities in one unified, easily updatable server.
* **🔒 Sandboxed Execution:** All skills run in an isolated environment. You can safely install third-party community skills without risking the integrity of your host application or primary infrastructure.
* **🧠 Powered by Agno:** Go beyond simple tools. Leverage Agno to build rich, stateful agent skills that can handle complex multi-step reasoning before returning the final payload via MCP.
* **📦 Dynamic Hot-Loading:** Add, update, or remove skills on the fly using `.zip` files, custom `.skill` packages, or direct download URLs without ever restarting the server.

## 🏗️ Architecture Concept

The system operates on a dual-interface architecture:

1. **REST API (The Manager):** A control plane to dynamically install, update, list, and delete skills. It acts as your private skill store.
2. **MCP Server (The Provider):** The execution plane that securely exposes the curated list of skills to your MCP-capable agents (n8n, Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.).

```bash
-H "X-API-Key: your_api_key"
```

Set `API_KEY` in your `.env` file.

## 📡 REST API — Control Plane

Interactive docs available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Skills Management

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/skills` | List all loaded skills |
| `GET` | `/skills/{name}` | Get full details of a skill |
| `POST` | `/skills` | Install a skill from URL or base64 zip |
| `POST` | `/skills/upload` | Install skill(s) via file upload |
| `DELETE` | `/skills/{name}` | Delete a skill |
| `GET` | `/skills/prompt_snippet` | Get system prompt snippet for agents (supports `?skill_list=skill1,skill2`) |

### Health Check

```
GET /health
```

Returns `200 OK` with the number of currently loaded skills.

## 📥 Installing Skills

*Note: You no longer need to provide a name. The server will automatically extract the skill name from the `SKILL.md` file inside the archive. If your folder or URL contains multiple skills, they will all be installed automatically.*

### 1. File Upload (multipart)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/skills/upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -F "file=@my_skill.zip"
```

### 2. URL (direct zip download)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/skills" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/my_skill.zip"}'
```

### 3. Agent Skills Discovery RFC (Index JSON) 📖

Install multiple skills curated in a `skills_index.json` file as defined by the [Cloudflare Discovery RFC](https://github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc):

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/skills" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdaTest/agent-skills/refs/heads/main/skills_index.json"}'
```

### 3. GitHub URL 🐙

You can point directly to a **GitHub repository** or a **subdirectory** inside one:

```bash
# Entire repository (uses main branch)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/skills" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://github.com/owner/repo"}'

# Specific branch
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/skills" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/develop"}'

# Specific subfolder inside a repo
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/skills" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator"}'
```

### 4. Base64 Zip

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/skills" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"zip_base64\": \"$(base64 -w0 my_skill.zip)\"}"
```

## 🤖 MCP Server — Provider Plane

The MCP server is mounted at `/mcp` using the **StreamableHTTP** transport.

### MCP Endpoint

| Transport | URL |
|-----------|-----|
| StreamableHTTP | `POST /mcp` |
| SSE | `GET /mcp/sse` |

### MCP Configuration (Claude Desktop / any MCP client)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skills": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_available_skills()` | List all loaded skills with name and description |
| `get_skill_instructions(skill_name)` | Load full instructions for a skill |
| `get_skill_reference(skill_name, reference_path)` | Read a reference document from a skill |
| `get_skill_script(skill_name, script_path, execute)` | Read or execute a script from a skill |

### Agent System Prompt Integration

To inject skill awareness into any agent, retrieve the pre-built prompt snippet. You can optionally pass `skill_list` to only include specific skills by name.

```bash
# Get snippet containing ALL installed skills
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/skills/prompt_snippet \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key"

# Get snippet filtered to specific skills
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/skills/prompt_snippet?skill_list=web_browsing,yahoo_finance" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key"
```

Paste the returned XML snippet into your agent's `system_prompt`. It describes the loaded skills and how to use the MCP tools to access them.

## 📂 Skill Structure

Each skill is a folder inside `SKILLS_DIR` with the following layout:

```
my_skill/
├── SKILL.md         # Required: frontmatter (name, description) + instructions
├── scripts/         # Optional: executable script files
│   └── run.py
└── references/      # Optional: documentation files
    └── guide.md
```

**`SKILL.md` example:**

```markdown
---
name: yahoo_finance
description: Fetch stock quotes and financial data from Yahoo Finance.
---

## Instructions

Use this skill when the user asks about stock prices or financial data...
```

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

### Core

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `API_KEY` | *(required)* | Secret key for REST API and MCP authentication |
| `SKILLS_DIR` | `skills` | Local directory for skill folders (used by `local` backend) |
| `SKILLS_STORAGE` | `local` | Storage backend: `local` or `s3` |

### S3 Storage (`SKILLS_STORAGE=s3`)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `S3_BUCKET` | *(required)* | S3 bucket name |
| `S3_PREFIX` | `skills/` | Key prefix acting as the remote skills root |
| `S3_CACHE_DIR` | `.s3cache` | Local directory where S3 files are cached |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | — | AWS access key (or use IAM role / `~/.aws/credentials`) |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | — | AWS secret key |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | `us-east-1` | AWS region |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` | — | Custom endpoint for MinIO / LocalStack |

---

## ☁️ Storage Backends

### Local (default)

Skills are loaded from the `SKILLS_DIR` folder on disk.
With Docker, a named volume (`skills_data`) is used for persistence:

```bash
# .env
SKILLS_STORAGE=local
SKILLS_DIR=skills
```

The `docker-compose.yml` mounts `skills_data:/app/skills` automatically —
skills survive `docker-compose down` / `up` cycles.

### S3 / S3-compatible

Skills are synced from an S3 bucket to a local cache dir on every `reload()`.
The `S3Skills` loader (`s3_skills.py`) follows the same `SkillLoader` interface as Agno's `LocalSkills`.

```bash
# .env
SKILLS_STORAGE=s3
S3_BUCKET=my-bucket
S3_PREFIX=skills/
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

# MinIO / LocalStack:
# AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:9000
```

Expected bucket layout:
```
my-bucket/
└── skills/
    ├── my_skill/
    │   ├── SKILL.md
    │   ├── scripts/run.py
    │   └── references/guide.md
    └── another_skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```
